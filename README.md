# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the School District Analysis

A school district asked for a snapshot of several key metrics by each school campus and by the district level. The main analysis focused on the performance of math and reading scores disaggregated several ways in preparation for a board meeting. However, after the school board reviewed the data, it was determined that the data from Thomas High School's 9th grade class was suspect. The school board asked for the data to be removed and analyzed again.

The testing data of the 9th graders at Thomas High School was turned into null data, which recalculated the percentages of passing math, passing reading, and the overall passing. The total count of students did not change as that was run on the count of the student ids, which was not turned into null data.

When comparing the two charts, the updated analysis had a nominal impact on the results. As you can see from the charts the differences in some of the metrics are minimal and the results would still round to the same whole number.
